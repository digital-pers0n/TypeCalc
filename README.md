#TypeCalc

Spotlight has a great builtin calculator, but it doesn't keep a history of 
previous expressions and results, also the window disappears when you switch 
between applications.

TypeCalc is a small application that basically doing same job as Spotlight's 
calculator, but it also records all previous expressions/results and app's 
window stays in place.

Currently, this application uses Calculate.framework to parse and evaluate 
arithmetic expressions.

Tested on macOS 10.11-11.0
